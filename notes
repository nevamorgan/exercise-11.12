Lecture 11/12
EDA, Normality, Tidymodels


Today we will focus on EDA from a statistical 
persepctive by focusing on aspects of the 
data needed to support the assumptions of 
models we might use (e.g. lm).

ggpubr is a packages in ggplot2
-simplified based plots to look at the properties described
-publication-ready interface for creating common statistical 
 plots with minimal coding.
 
Easily adds statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) 
to plots with functions like "stat_compare_means()".


ggpar() - modify themes, labels, legends
ggarange(), ggexport() - arrange multiple plots in a grid and export them.
ggscatter - integrate correlation coefficients and regression lines effortlessly
ggpubr - compare groups by adding p-values, cofidence intervals, etc.

EX.# Boxplot with p-values
ggboxplot(ToothGrowth, x = "supp", y = "len",  color = "supp", palette = "jco") +
  stat_compare_means(method = "t.test")
